This is a repo to work with and use Chainlink smart contracts in a python environment. If you're brand new to Chainlink, check out the beginner walkthroughs in remix to [learn the basics.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/beginners-tutorial)

You can also check out the more advanced Chainlink tutorials there as well. 

## Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:

- [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
## Installation

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), if you haven't already. Here is a simple way to install brownie.

```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

2. [Install ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

3. Download the mix and install dependancies. 

```bash
brownie bake chainlink-mix
cd chainlink-mix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will open up a new Chainlink project. Or, you can clone from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/chainlink-mix
cd chainlink-mix 
```

If you want to be able to deploy to testnets, do the following. 

1. Set your `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html). 

You can get a `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` by getting a free trial of [Infura](https://infura.io/). At the moment, it does need to be infura with brownie. You can find your `PRIVATE_KEY` from your ethereum wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io/). 

You'll also need testnet rinkeby ETH and LINK. You can get LINK and ETH into your wallet by using the [rinkeby faucets located here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts#rinkeby). If you're new to this, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7FX_1PePX0)

You can add your environment variables to the `.env` file:

```
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

AND THEN RUN `source .env` TO ACTIVATE THE ENV VARIABLES
(You'll need to do this everytime you open a new terminal, or [learn how to set them easier](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html))


Otherwise, you can build, test, and deploy on your local environment. 

## Chainlink Price Feeds

This mix provides a simple template for working with Chainlink Smart Contracts. The easiest way to start is to fork the mainnet chain to a local ganache chain. This will allow you to deploy local smart contracts to interact with the [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price). 

### Running Scripts

This will deploy a smart contract to kovan and then read you the latest price via [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price). 
```
brownie run scripts/price_feed_scripts/deploy_price_consumer_v3.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/price_feed_scripts/read_price_feed.py --network kovan
```

Otherwise, you can fork mainnet and use that in a local ganache development environment.
```bash
brownie console --network mainnet-fork
>>> price_feeds = PriceFeed.deploy('0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419', {'from': accounts[0]})
.
.
>>> latest_price = price_feeds.getLatestPrice()
>>> latest_price
59169208540
```

You can also use [ENS](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ens) to get prices. See the [ens price feed script](./scripts/price_feed_scripts/read_price_with_ens.py) for more information. 

## Chainlink VRF

This will deploy a smart contract to kovan and get a Random number via [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number). 
```
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/deploy_vrf.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/fund_vrf.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/request_randomness.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/vrf_scripts/read_random_number.py --network kovan
```

## Chainlink API Call


This will deploy a smart contract to kovan and then make an API call via [Chainlink API Call](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request). 
```
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/deploy_api_consumer.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/fund_chainlink_api.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/request_api.py --network kovan
brownie run scripts/chainlink_api_scripts/read_data.py --network kovan
```

## Testing

```
brownie test
```

For more information on effective testing with Chainlink, check out [Testing Smart Contracts](https://blog.chain.link/testing-chainlink-smart-contracts/)

Tests are really robust here! They work for local development and testnets. There are a few key differences between the testnets and the local networks. We utilize mocks so we can work with fake oracles on our testnets. 

There is a `test_unnecessary` folder, which is a good exersize for learning some of the nitty-gritty of smart contract development. It's overkill, so pytest will skip them intentionally. It also has a `test_samples` folder, which shows an example Chainlink API call transaction receipt. 


### To test development / local
```bash
brownie test
```
### To test mainnet-fork
This will test the same way as local testing, but you will need a connection to a mainnet blockchain (like with the infura environment variable.)
```bash
brownie test --network mainnet-fork
```
### To test a testnet
Kovan and Rinkeby are currently supported
```bash
brownie test --network kovan
```

## Adding additional Chains

If the blockchain is EVM Compatible, adding new chains can be accomplished by something like:

```
brownie networks add Ethereum binance-smart-chain host=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org chainid=56
```
or, for a fork: 

```
brownie networks add development binance-fork cmd=ganache-cli host=http://127.0.0.1 fork=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org accounts=10 mnemonic=brownie port=8545
```

## Linting

```
pip install black 
pip install autoflake
autoflake --in-place --remove-unused-variables -r .
black .
```
