This folder is for super crazy over the top testing. But a good exersize if you want to understand how oracle contracts work in depth. It tests a lot of the Chainlink core code, rather than your api_consumer implementation. It does into deploying an oracle contract on a testnet and making calls through it. 

The "test_samples" is so you have an idea of what a transaction receipt looks like. The logs are where a lot of the important events are exported to.
